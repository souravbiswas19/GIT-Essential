Assignment:

1. You need to create five different files in your git repository and commit them in separate commits (i.e. there will be five commits). And you have to push these files to the master branch.                                                                                                    (2 points)

1.txt

Do or do not, there is no try.

2.txt

Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.

3.txt

Get busy living, or get busy dying.

4.txt

It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.

5.txt

I find your lack of faith disturbing.

 2. Then you need to create one branch called "feature-rename-files" and change all files name to below                                                                                                      (2 points)

1.txt > yoda.txt

2.txt > godfather.txt

3.txt > shawshank.txt

4.txt > batman.txt

5.txt > vader.txt

After changing all files name, you need to merge this feature-rename-files branch into master branch.

3. After this, you need to push two separate commits in master branch.              (1 point)

i.e.

i) Commit 1:
master -> change yoda.txt

Do or do not, there is no try. -> No try there is, do or do not.

ii) Commit 2:
master -> change godfather.txt

Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. -> Keep your enemies close,          but your friends distant.

4. Now checkout the feature-rename-files branch and push two different commits in feature-rename-files branch.                                                                                         (1 point)

i.e.

i) Commit 1 : 
feature-rename-files -> change yoda.txt

Do or do not, there is no try. -> DO OR DO NOT, THERE IS NO TRY.

ii) Commit 2:
feature-rename-files -> change godfather.txt

Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. -> KEEP YOUR FRIENDS              CLOSE, BUT YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER.

5. Now rebase your feature-rename-files branch with the master branch. If there are any conflicts while rebasing, choose the followings to resolve conflicts:            (3 points)      
       1. Pick all changes of master for conflicts in Yoda.txt
       2. Pick all changes of feature-rename-files in godfather.txt 

6. Now send the Pull request in Github from feature-rename-files to master     (1 point)

7. Now, create one folder with the name Assignment. And add the following assignments to that folder.                                                                                      (4 points)

        1. Capture a screenshot of your Git bash commands that you have used

8.  Now you have to push this Assignment folder to new branch called feature-assignment                                                                                                                         (1 point)

After this, you need to push all your changes to Github repository & submit repository link here.
